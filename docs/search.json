    "text": "Course Description and Objectives\nThis course emphasizes exposure to diverse data mining methods, with a particular focus on experimental designs and predictive modeling techniques. It provides a comprehensive understanding of the roles that data and analytics disciplines play in business decision-making. Through the analysis of synthetic, business-focused datasets, students will engage in a hands-on experiential learning process that highlights the practical applications of these methods. This approach underscores the interconnected nature of experimental and predictive techniques within the broader analytics landscape, enabling students to develop a nuanced appreciation of data-driven decision-making. By the end of the course, students will be better equipped to thoughtfully select advanced analytics courses and strategically navigate their paths toward specialized or advanced training in fields aligned with data analytics.\nCourse Website: https://davi-moreira.github.io/2025F_data_mining_purdue_MGMT173/\n\nInstructor: Professor Davi Moreira\n\nEmail: dmoreira@purdue.edu\nVirtual Office hours - Zoom link in your Course Brightspace Page\nIndividual Appointments: Book time with me through the link in the course syllabus on your Course Brightspace Page or by appointment.",
