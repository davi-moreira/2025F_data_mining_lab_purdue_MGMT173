## Course Description and Objectives

This course emphasizes exposure to diverse data mining methods, with a particular focus on experimental designs and predictive modeling techniques. It provides a comprehensive understanding of the various roles that data and analytics disciplines play in business decision-making. Through the analysis of numerous synthetic, business-focused datasets, students will engage in a hands-on experiential learning process that highlights the practical applications of these methods. This approach underscores the interconnected nature of experimental and predictive techniques within the broader analytics landscape, enabling students to develop a nuanced appreciation of data-driven decision-making. By the end of the course, students will be better equipped to thoughtfully select advanced analytics courses and strategically navigate their paths toward specialized or advanced training in fields aligned with data analytics.

### Course Infra-structure

**Brightspace:** The Course Brightspace Page <https://purdue.brightspace.com/> should be checked on a regular basis for announcements and course material.

## Assessments

As part of a university-wide initiative, the Business School has adopted an **Official Grading Policy** that caps the overall class GPA at 3.3. Final letter grades are determined by curving final percentages, subject to any extra-credit exceptions discussed in this syllabus. While you will see your final percentage in Brightspace, individual grade thresholds will not be disclosed before official submissions.

| **Assessment**             | **Weight** |
|----------------------------|-----------:|
| Attendance                 | 3%         |
| Participation              | 7%         |
| Quizzes                    | 25%        |
| Homework                   | 25%        |
| Online Midterm Exams       | 20%        |
| Final Project              | 20%        |

### Attendance 

Attendance is essential for success in this course. If you do not attend class regularly, you are unlikely to succeed. According to the University regulations, “Scheduled courses allow students to avoid conflicts and reflect the University’s expectation that students should be present for every meeting of a class/laboratory for which they are registered.” Attendance will be recorded using iClicker, and these records will be reflected in your gradebook at the end of the semester. A minimum attendance rate of 85% is required to meet the expectations of this course.

### Participation

Participate and take participatory activities. Almost every class the instructor you will be required to take participatory activities. Your participation grade will be based on this record. The two lowest scores will be dropped.

### Quizzes

Regular quizzes based on lecture material will be administered, with no drops. Due dates and details will be on Brightspace. Quizzes help reinforce content and maintain steady engagement.

### Homework

Homework assignments offer practical, hands-on exposure to data mining tasks. Expect multiple-choice questions requiring analysis of provided results. Deadlines will be posted in Brightspace. These assignments are crucial for building technical and analytical skills.

### Online Midterm Exams

Two midterm exams, administered online, incorporate the methods used in quizzes and homework but in a more comprehensive format. They are open-book and open-notes. Students have 60 minutes to complete multiple-choice questions that test both technical proficiency and conceptual understanding. The second midterm is not cumulative. Makeup exams are granted only for verifiable, exceptional circumstances (e.g., serious personal medical emergency, family death, NCAA conflict).

### Final Project

In groups, students will complete a practical data mining project, culminating in a team presentation submitted via Brightspace. The project provides an opportunity to apply course concepts to a real-world scenario, demonstrating analytical and problem-solving skills. Detailed guidelines will be provided according to the course schedule.

### Grade Challenges

Grades and solutions will be posted soon after each assignment deadline. Students have **7 calendar days** from the grade posting to submit any challenge (3 days for the final two quizzes and homework assignments). Challenges must be based on legitimate discrepancies regarding data mining principles or grading accuracy.

1. **Review posted solutions** thoroughly.  
2. If you suspect an error, email Dr. Moreira with:  
   - Course name, section, and lecture day/time  
   - Your name and Student ID  
   - Assignment/Exam Title or Number  
   - Specific deduction questioned  
   - Clear rationale referencing solutions or rubrics  

> *No grades will be discussed in-class. Please use office hours for clarifications. After the 7-day (or 3-day) window, grades are final.*
